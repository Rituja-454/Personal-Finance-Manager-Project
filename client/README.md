<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->

Project Description :

This Personal Finance Manager Project allows users to register and log in using email and password, displaying the logged-in user's name on their profile icon. On the home page, users can add transactions, and the system calculates and displays the total balance, total expenses, and total income. The transactions section includes a table where users can filter transactions by All, Expenses, and Income, with additional filters for All Transactions, Last Week, and Last Month. In the reports section, an Income vs. Expense bar graph and a category-wise expense pie chart are displayed, both filterable by All, Last Week, and Last Month. The budgets section enables users to set budgets for expense categories and list future payments to control spending.
